Instructions to run locally

Backend Server

Make sure you have  mysql installed in your system. Start the mysql service on your machine. We are using mySQL as our database service, so we need it running on our machine.


Create a database , you may use Mysql client on your machine or install MySQLWorkbench for that.[It’s a GUI platform and is handy to use]


Create a .env file in the root folder of the project and fill in the details according to your setup. I’m sharing a sample .env file here.


DB_HOST = "localhost"

DB_NAME = ""

DB_USERNAME = ""

DB_PASSWORD = ""



PORT = 8000
